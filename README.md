# ecosia_image_scrapper
Ecosia based image scrapper for patch downloading 

very easy to use, just input the path where you want to make the new image directory and url for image websearch. 

THIS SCRAPPERS IS DESIGNED TO HANDLE ONLY IMAGE SEARCH URLS ON ECOSIA ONLY. 
ECOSIA PROVIDES A MUCH EASIER PLATFORM FRO SCRAPPING SINCE THEIR IMAGE XPATH AND BUTTON XPATH ARE STATIC MAKING IT SIMPLER TO SCRAPE FROM AS OPPOSE TO OTHER SEARCH ENGINES WHERE MARKETING MATERIAL IN THE MIDDLE MAKES IT HARD TO COMPLETE A 50 IMAGE SCRAPE. 


INPUT: 
FOR FOLDER INPUT IF FOLDER NAME DOESN'T EXIST IN THE DIRECTORY, os WILL MAKE A NEW FOLDER UNDER THE DESIRED NAME. 
FOR URL INPUT ONLY INPUT URL OF IMAGE SEARCH ON ECOSIA EXCLUSIVLY 





HAPPY SCRAPPING!
